# Stack

ReactJS, TS, NextJS for front end
pnpm package manager
tailwind + css for styling

# Reasoning for stack choice

Next provides strong integration with TS, and sets up nice rounting between pages making the coding experience better. TS and React because they are what I'm most confortable in.

pnpm downloads and globaly caches packages faster than npm

tailwind for quick and consistent design changes, css for trying to match exact designs from figma
